# TextEcho
On macOS, the built-in say command can be used to convert text to speech directly from the terminal. However, on Windows and other systems, there is no such native command. This Python project provides a simple and effective text-to-speech solution using the pyttsx3 library, which works  on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
